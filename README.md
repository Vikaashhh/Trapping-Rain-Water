# 📅 Day 59 – GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🌊 Problem: Trapping Rain Water
### 🧠 Difficulty: Hard
### 📌 Tags: #Day59 #gfg160 #geekstreak2025
### 🚀 Status: Solved in 1 Attempt ✅

## 📋 Problem Statement:
Given an array representing the elevation map, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## ⚙️ Approach Used: Two-Pointer with Constant Space Optimization
💡 Key Insight:
Instead of precomputing left and right max arrays (O(n) space), we dynamically tracked the max heights from both ends using two pointers, allowing an O(n) time and O(1) space solution.
